# luci-app-monitor

[中文](README.md)

luci-app-monitor is a read-only real-time LuCI monitor for OpenWrt and
ImmortalWrt. After installation, open it at Status -> Router Monitor.

## Features

- Refreshes CPU, memory, and network data asynchronously every three seconds by
  default. A page-level selector applies any interval from 1 to 60 seconds
  immediately and resets to three seconds when the page is reopened.
- Sends monitor samples without waiting for animation frames that can pause in
  background tabs, preventing the refresh requests from stalling on that queue.
- Calculates aggregate multi-core CPU usage from /proc/stat.
- Reports physical memory usage as (total - free) / total, excluding swap.
- Shows sensor names and temperatures in degrees Celsius when lm-sensors
  returns valid temperature inputs; otherwise the temperature section is hidden.
- The top download/upload summary includes only the firewall zone named wan.
  Each eligible lower device is counted once: RX is download from upstream and
  TX is upload to upstream.
- The interface table includes netifd interfaces and Linux network devices with
  byte counters, including physical NICs, bridges, VLAN, PPP, WireGuard, TUN,
  TAP, GRE, and VETH devices.
- Connected rows show their IPv4 addresses below the status. Merged rows label
  each connected logical interface's addresses, keeping PPP and lower-device
  management addresses distinct. Unbound devices show their own addresses.
  Rows without IPv4, connecting rows, and disconnected rows show only status;
  IPv6 and stale addresses are not displayed.
- The Connections column after Status counts TCP, UDP, and other bidirectional
  conntrack records, including tracked TIME_WAIT states. Each record counts
  once per row; traffic traversing different networks can count in both rows.
  These are not client counts, and adding rows does not give a global total.
- Attribution uses original/reply addresses, NAT addresses, and interface
  subnets. Unaddressed bridge ports, overlapping networks, and forwarding
  without a reliable egress association show `-`; disconnected rows show `0`.
  LuCI's native direct read retrieves the complete connection table without
  the small-file limit of ordinary RPC reads.
- RX, TX, Total RX, and Total TX in the interface table use the literal Linux
  device direction for every row. A LAN bridge row is not rewritten from a
  client-relative point of view.
- Rates automatically use KB/s, MB/s, or GB/s. Totals use KB, MB, GB, or TB.
  Values have two decimal places, and connection start times use the router timezone.

All data comes from kernel counters for the current router boot. The package has
no daemon, database, configuration file, or persistent history.

## Build from source

Check out a complete OpenWrt or ImmortalWrt source tree matching the firmware
family and series on the router, then initialize that tree's documented build
environment and feeds. From the source-tree root:

~~~sh
git clone https://github.com/haitun001/luci-app-monitor.git package/luci-app-monitor
./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a
make defconfig
make package/luci-app-monitor/clean \
  CONFIG_PACKAGE_luci-app-monitor=m \
  CONFIG_PACKAGE_luci-i18n-monitor-zh-cn=m
make package/luci-app-monitor/compile V=s \
  CONFIG_PACKAGE_luci-app-monitor=m \
  CONFIG_PACKAGE_luci-i18n-monitor-zh-cn=m
find bin/packages -type f \( -name 'luci-app-monitor*' -o -name 'luci-i18n-monitor-zh-cn*' \)
~~~

This builds both the main package and the Simplified Chinese language package.
Do not use an ImmortalWrt Release artifact with OpenWrt, or vice versa.

## Install from a Release

Open [Releases](https://github.com/haitun001/luci-app-monitor/releases) and
select both the luci-app-monitor main package and
luci-i18n-monitor-zh-cn package whose prefix exactly matches the firmware
family and series.

| Release prefix | Format |
| --- | --- |
| openwrt-24.10.8 | IPK |
| openwrt-25.12.5 | APK |
| openwrt-snapshot | APK |
| immortalwrt-24.10.6 | IPK |
| immortalwrt-25.12.1 | APK |
| immortalwrt-master | APK |

### ImmortalWrt 25.12.1 install or upgrade command

Run this single command as root on an ImmortalWrt 25.12.1 router with LuCI
already installed. It downloads the v0.5 application and Simplified Chinese
packages from GitHub into a private /tmp directory, verifies both SHA-256
checksums, then allows untrusted package signatures and replaces an existing
version. It cleans its downloads on success, failure, or a catchable interrupt
without matching unrelated APKs elsewhere in /tmp.

~~~sh
(set -eu; dir=$(mktemp -d /tmp/luci-monitor-v0.5.XXXXXX); trap 'rm -f "$dir"/*.apk "$dir/SHA256SUMS" "$dir/CHECKSUMS"; rmdir "$dir"' EXIT; trap 'exit 1' HUP INT TERM; cd "$dir"; base=https://github.com/haitun001/luci-app-monitor/releases/download/v0.5; app=immortalwrt-25.12.1-luci-app-monitor-0.5-r1.apk; zh=immortalwrt-25.12.1-luci-i18n-monitor-zh-cn-0.5-r1.apk; for file in "$app" "$zh" SHA256SUMS; do wget -T 60 -O "$file" "$base/$file"; done; awk -v a="$app" -v z="$zh" '$2==a || $2==z {count[$2]++; print} END {exit(count[a]!=1 || count[z]!=1)}' SHA256SUMS > CHECKSUMS; sha256sum -c CHECKSUMS; apk add --allow-untrusted --force-reinstall --no-network --repositories-file /dev/null "$dir/$app" "$dir/$zh")
~~~

The command requires HTTPS access to GitHub. It bypasses package-signature
trust only, retaining HTTPS and SHA-256 verification. It does not change
repositories, upgrade unrelated software, or use --force-depends.

For other firmware, download both matching packages, verify them with
SHA256SUMS, and transfer them to a dedicated temporary directory. Use
`opkg install` on 24.10, or `apk add --allow-untrusted` on 25.12, Snapshot,
and master, followed by the two explicit local package paths. After installation,
remove only those files and the directory you created. Do not mix firmware
families or series.

Refresh or log in to LuCI again and open Status -> Router Monitor.

## Compatibility and verification

- Supports LuCI-equipped OpenWrt and ImmortalWrt 24.10 and later.
- The v0.5 CI matrix builds OpenWrt 24.10.8, 25.12.5, and Snapshot, plus
  ImmortalWrt 24.10.6, 25.12.1, and master.
- The IPK main package is all and APK is noarch. CPU architecture is generally
  not a restriction, but firmware family, release series, and package manager
  must match.
- By agreement, v0.5 validation covers research, local checks, and all six SDK
  CI targets: paused animation frames, shared requests, failure recovery,
  accounting logic, translations, and the installer. Firefox is not installed
  or tested; router installation, desktop/mobile page checks, and the
  eight-minute soak are omitted. The v0.4 runtime results are historical only.
- Connection records are retained only for the current refresh. Total RX/TX
  remain boot-session counters and do not restart after a disconnect. This
  release does not change LuCI authentication or session expiry.
- The sensors command is an optional probe. Missing lm-sensors or temperature
  inputs do not affect the other metrics.

The Firefox investigation uses [MDN's background scheduling documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API)
and the [LuCI request queue source](https://github.com/openwrt/luci/blob/2fc28c43d2d66acec3d18084737df8781bb0415b/modules/luci-base/htdocs/luci-static/resources/luci.js#L738).
A local simulation confirms that paused animation frames leave default batched
requests queued, while native `nobatch` requests can send. This does not establish
the reported trigger. Browser suspension, computer sleep, or lost connectivity
can still expire the session and require a new login; the plugin does not extend
the session timeout or log in automatically.

## Maintainer release process

For a new release, update PKG_VERSION in Makefile and increment PKG_RELEASE
when appropriate, and add matching release notes to CHANGELOG.md. Commit and
push main, wait for all six CI builds to pass, then push a v* tag matching
PKG_VERSION. The tag workflow rebuilds 12 packages, generates SHA256SUMS, and
creates the GitHub Release with the matching changelog entry.

Run local logic checks with `node tests/monitor-unit.js`, and use
`node tests/install-command.js` with a POSIX shell to check installer validation
and cleanup on failure. The real-page suite
is `tests/router-e2e.js`; provide the router URL, credentials, Chrome path, and
an output directory outside the repository through environment variables. The
default soak is eight minutes. Install matching firmware-series branch
artifacts for router verification before creating the release tag. The agreed
v0.5 exception omits router checks, using local validation, all six branch CI
targets, and Release artifact verification as the release requirements.
