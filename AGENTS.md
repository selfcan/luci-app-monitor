# luci-app-monitor Development Contract

## Scope

- Build only the LuCI application named by this directory: `luci-app-monitor`.
- Register one read-only page at `Status -> Router Monitor` (`/admin/status/monitor`).
- Keep the implementation native to LuCI and OpenWrt. Do not add daemons,
  databases, configuration pages, history, custom CSS, or runtime dependencies
  beyond `luci-base`.
- Source strings are English. Maintain Simplified Chinese translations in
  `po/zh_Hans/monitor.po` and the template in `po/templates/monitor.pot`.

## Runtime Contract

- Refresh live data through one LuCI `poll.add()` callback. Default to three
  seconds and expose a non-persistent native selector for every integer from
  one through 60 seconds.
- On an interval change, replace the registered interval and request one
  immediate refresh. Reuse any in-flight refresh so requests never overlap.
- Keep the native LuCI session lifecycle. All monitor sampling RPCs use
  `nobatch: true` so paused animation frames cannot stall the refresh queue.
  Do not add separate keepalive timers, change session timeouts, or auto-login.
  Browser suspension, sleep, and lost connectivity can still expire sessions.
  The reported Firefox trigger is unconfirmed; no Firefox runtime test is claimed.
- Place Connections immediately after Status. Read the complete conntrack
  table with native fs.read_direct('/proc/net/nf_conntrack') and exact read
  permission plus cgi-io download access. Ordinary file.read truncates this
  proc file to 4096 bytes and must not be used for connection counts.
- Read conntrack only from the poll callback, avoiding two large reads during
  page initialization. Initial connection counts show '-' until the first poll.
- Count each original/reply conntrack record once per associated accounting
  device, including all tracked protocols and states. Use addresses, NAT
  tuples and interface subnets; do not infer a policy-routed egress or copy a
  bridge count to its unaddressed ports. Incomplete or ambiguous attribution
  and failed/malformed reads show '-'; disconnected rows show zero.
- Update existing text nodes in place. Rebuild a table body only when the set
  of interface or sensor keys changes. Never replace focused controls.
- Use native HTML fallback labels when a mobile theme hides table headings
  without supplying data-title labels. Keep summary rows full-width and use
  the theme's own styles; no custom CSS is needed.
- Connected status includes IPv4 addresses from each active netifd logical
  member's ipv4-address list. Merged rows label each member; raw rows use
  their own getNetworkDevices ipaddrs. Deduplicate within each member and
  sort by interface/address. Never borrow a lower device's management IP,
  gateway or PPP peer address for another logical member. Hide addresses
  when disconnected, connecting or without valid IPv4; do not display IPv6.
- Keep status/address text nodes stable as addresses change. Translate all
  static labels, including mobile labels, menu and ACL descriptions.
- Read aggregate CPU counters from `/proc/stat`. Calculate multi-core CPU usage
  from consecutive `cpu` samples, counting idle and iowait as idle. A first,
  malformed, reset, or non-increasing sample displays `-`.
- Physical memory usage is `(total - free) / total`; swap is excluded.
- Probe `/usr/sbin/sensors -j -A` through an exact read-only ACL. Treat a valid
  top-level JSON object as a probe result regardless of command exit status;
  lm-sensors returns code 1 with `{}` when no sensors exist. Retry at most three
  missing, malformed, or non-object results. If a valid result contains no
  temperatures, hide temperature output and stop probing for that session.
- Enumerate every netifd logical interface with a usable `device` or
  `l3_device`, preferring the layer-2 `device` for accounting. Merge logical
  names and associated dynamic children which share one accounting device.
- Add every remaining Linux network device reported by
  `luci-rpc.getNetworkDevices` when it has byte counters. Exclude only loopback,
  control interfaces, and unused kernel tunnel placeholders; do not omit an
  explicitly mapped logical device because of its name.
- Display one row per accounting device. Logical rows use
  `network/network6 (device)` and unbound devices use the device name. Table
  directions are literal RX and TX for every physical, bridge, VLAN, wireless,
  PPP, and tunnel device; never infer LAN-relative directions for generic rows.
- Derive a logical row's state and connection time from an active default-route
  member, then from the first active member. Raw devices use kernel link state
  and show `-` for connection time. Disconnected rows show zero rates while
  retaining available boot-session RX and TX totals.
- Use the firewall zone named `wan` as the overall traffic boundary. Resolve
  eligible configured networks, netifd interfaces which request that zone at
  runtime, plus exact and prefix-wildcard raw zone devices. Exclude
  management-only networks with `defaultroute='0'` unless they own an active
  default route.
- Prefer each eligible WAN network's netifd layer-2 `device`; use its
  `l3_device` only when no lower device is available. If any physical/layer-2
  WAN candidate exists, do not also sum unresolved point-to-point candidates.
  Resolve direct upper-device matches through their logical group. Sum each
  connected WAN device once, with RX as download and TX as upload.
- Calculate rates from counter deltas and actual elapsed time. A first sample,
  device change, counter reset, or non-positive interval yields zero.
- Use a monotonic browser clock. Calculate WAN device rates separately before
  summing them, so one counter reset cannot cancel another device's traffic.
- Format speed with binary units from `KB/s` through `GB/s`, and totals from
  `KB` through `TB`, always with two decimals.
- Derive connection start from router epoch minus interface uptime and render
  `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` in the router's configured timezone.
- Data is boot-session state only. Do not persist samples, counters, or the
  selected refresh interval.

## Security And Repository Rules

- RPC and filesystem permissions must be read-only and least-privilege.
- Never store router credentials, host keys, APKs, screenshots, build output,
  or temporary test fixtures in Git.
- Do not use or modify `/home/ht/immortalwrt`; the user withdrew it
  as a supported build environment after deleting the original repository.
  Use the existing GitHub Actions SDK matrix as the authoritative build path.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual source edits. Keep code minimal and avoid
  speculative abstractions or unused compatibility paths.
- Update this file when a verified behavior, constraint, or test result changes.

## Release Contract

- The initial public release is `v0.1`. The current public release is `v0.5`;
  both `luci-app-monitor` and `luci-i18n-monitor-zh-cn` use package version
  `0.5-r1`.
- Publish under Apache License 2.0 at
  `https://github.com/haitun001/luci-app-monitor`.
- Keep `README.md` in Chinese and `README_EN.md` in English. Both documents
  must describe features, source-tree builds, Release installation, supported
  firmware series, artifact selection, verification scope, and maintenance.
- GitHub Actions builds on pushes to `main` and manual dispatch. A matching
  `v*` tag additionally creates a GitHub Release. The tag version must equal
  `PKG_VERSION`.
- Build main and Simplified Chinese packages for OpenWrt 24.10.8, 25.12.5,
  Snapshot, ImmortalWrt 24.10.6, 25.12.1, and master. Release assets contain
  exactly those 12 packages plus `SHA256SUMS`.
- OpenWrt/ImmortalWrt 24.10 artifacts are IPK packages. 25.12 and development
  snapshots are APK packages. Do not mix firmware family or series artifacts.
- Verify branch CI before creating or moving a release tag. Pin third-party
  Actions by commit and use the GitHub CLI for Release creation.
- The supplied router is x86_64 ImmortalWrt 25.12.1. Use matching 25.12.1
  packages for runtime verification. Earlier master runtime results remain
  historical evidence, not v0.3 runtime verification of master.

## Required Verification Before Delivery

- For v0.5 only, the user explicitly waived router installation, real-browser
  checks, and the eight-minute soak. Use documentation research, local tests,
  all six branch/tag SDK CI targets, and Release artifact verification instead.
  Do not install Firefox or describe simulations or v0.4 results as v0.5 runtime
  verification. The routine requirements below still apply to other releases.
- Validate JavaScript syntax, JSON, translations, LuCI i18n extraction, and
  package metadata.
- Build the application and Simplified Chinese packages in all six GitHub
  Actions SDK targets. Use the successful ImmortalWrt 25.12.1 branch artifacts
  for pre-tag router verification.
- Install both packages on the supplied router and test the real LuCI page in
  English and Chinese at desktop and mobile sizes.
- Verify the default three-second cadence, immediate interval changes at the
  one- and 60-second boundaries, calculations, selector focus preservation,
  stable DOM size, no console errors, and the temperature UI with an
  intercepted valid lm-sensors JSON response.
- Complete an eight-minute browser soak and record request intervals, DOM size,
  console errors, and forced-GC heap before and after. Run a 30-minute soak only
  when the user explicitly requests that duration.
- For `v0.2`, additionally run an explicitly requested three-minute soak at a
  selected one-second interval and record the same resource and stability data.
- Remove router-side APKs and test artifacts; leave only installed packages.

## Progress

- 2026-09-20: v0.5 scope is confirmed: investigate the Firefox login-session
  report without installing Firefox, fix the documented animation-frame RPC
  queue stall, publish bilingual release notes, and copy the ImmortalWrt
  25.12.1-only installer to the Windows clipboard after Release verification.
  MDN documents background animation-frame suspension. OpenWrt/ImmortalWrt
  LuCI 24.10, 25.12 and master support `nobatch`; the 25.12 request code at
  `2fc28c43d2d66acec3d18084737df8781bb0415b` reproduces a queued RPC with
  animation frames withheld while a `nobatch` RPC sends. The queued XHR has
  not yet started its timeout. Rpcd session lookup refreshes the idle timeout.
  This establishes a failure mechanism, not the user's unknown trigger.
  The user explicitly chose local checks and CI only for this release.
- 2026-09-20: The v0.5 sampling change, `0.5-r1` metadata, bilingual notes and
  versioned installer are implemented. Local checks pass paused-frame refreshes,
  shared slow reads, interval changes, error recovery and sensor retries; the
  same regression check fails against v0.4 as expected. An additional in-memory
  check using pinned upstream LuCI request/rpc/fs code reproduces v0.4 stalling
  and v0.5 completing consecutive samples without animation frames, preserving
  file-error fallback and sensors exit-code-1 JSON. JavaScript/JSON/YAML,
  package metadata, gettext, all 20 LuCI-extracted translations and installer
  success/failure cleanup checks pass. Installer checks run under WSL/POSIX.
  Six-target branch/tag CI and final Release verification are pending.
- 2026-09-20: Branch CI `35498272298` passed validation and all six SDK targets
  for `ac09acd` before the annotated `v0.5` tag was created. Tag CI
  `35498993042` passed all six targets and published the normal public Release.
  Its notes exactly match the bilingual changelog, and its assets are exactly
  twelve `0.5-r1` packages plus `SHA256SUMS`. Downloading all thirteen assets
  verifies every checksum. IPK/APK metadata, architecture, dependency and
  minimal file-manifest checks pass; every target contains identical view and
  Chinese LMO content. The packaged view passes the logic and paused-frame
  regression suite. The exact README installer passes real Release downloads,
  SHA-256 validation and private-directory cleanup under WSL, with only the
  package-installation call stubbed. Firefox and router runtime checks were
  intentionally omitted under the agreed v0.5 exception. The final 710-character
  ImmortalWrt 25.12.1 installer was copied to the Windows clipboard and read
  back byte-for-byte equal to both README commands.

- 2026-09-06: v0.4 scope is confirmed: show IPv4 only, label all connected
  logical members in merged rows, review all English/Chinese strings, publish
  v0.4 and deploy to the supplied ImmortalWrt 25.12.1 router. Its existing
  netifd/device RPCs expose the required addresses, including distinct modem
  and PPP addresses sharing eth4. GitHub HTTPS access and native wget/apk
  options were inspected. The installation command must download exactly the
  two matching APKs, verify both checksums, install offline with untrusted
  signatures allowed, and clean only its private /tmp directory.
- 2026-09-06: v0.4 IPv4 rendering, all 20 translated strings, 0.4-r1 metadata,
  bilingual documentation and the isolated installer are implemented. Local
  logic, JavaScript/JSON/YAML, gettext, upstream LuCI extraction and whitespace
  checks pass. The installer check covers successful installation, failed
  downloads, corrupt/missing/duplicate checksums and installation failure,
  verifying cleanup without touching an unrelated APK. Source-overridden
  browser checks pass 4004 connection records, interval boundaries, shared
  slow reads, address changes/disconnection/reconnection with stable DOM and
  focus, and sensor retries. One-second intervals are 996-1004 ms, five-second
  intervals 5002-5005 ms, and concurrent poll/conntrack reads are each one.
  Desktop and freshly loaded mobile screenshots show no cell overflow; a
  resize-only mobile fixture is reloaded to close the theme's retained desktop
  navigation before its screenshot. SDK and installed-package tests are pending.
- 2026-09-06: Branch CI `34013249848` passed validation and all six SDK
  targets for `fef9c88`. The matching ImmortalWrt 25.12.1 APKs passed SHA-256,
  apk verification and manifest inspection before upgrading the router from
  0.3-r1 to 0.4-r1. Installed view, menu, ACL and Chinese LMO hashes match
  the archives. The main package remains noarch with only native libc and
  luci-base dependencies. Uploaded branch APKs and their directory were removed.
- 2026-09-06: The installed v0.4 branch runtime passed all fixtures, including
  4004 conntrack records, raw/merged IPv4 ownership, repeated address changes,
  disconnect/reconnect and pending state with stable text nodes and focus.
  Seven English/Chinese desktop/mobile, address and sensor screenshots were
  visually checked without overlap, overflow or column mismatch. The eight-minute
  soak recorded 160 samples at 2979-3015 ms (3000.050 ms average), DOM
  426 before/after/maximum, forced-GC heap 3193532 -> 3161080 bytes, one
  concurrent poll and conntrack read, one sensor probe and no console/page
  errors or logout. One-second intervals were 989-1008 ms; five-second
  intervals were 4989-5006 ms. Network, firewall and LuCI configuration
  hashes remain unchanged. Annotated tag v0.4 points to this verified
  fef9c88 commit; tag CI `34014036466` and final Release installation are pending.
- 2026-09-06: Tag CI `34014036466` passed validation, all six SDK targets
  and Release publication. Public v0.4 is neither draft nor prerelease and
  contains exactly twelve expected packages plus SHA256SUMS. Downloading all
  thirteen assets and verifying every package checksum passes. The exact
  single-line command in both READMEs downloaded the two 25.12.1 Release APKs
  directly on the router, checked their hashes, replaced both installed
  0.4-r1 packages offline and automatically removed its temporary directory.
  Full SHA-256 hashes of all four installed runtime files match the archives
  used for the eight-minute test. Installed database manifests use shortened
  sha256-160 records, so compare full on-disk hashes with archive manifests
  instead of comparing the two manifest formats as text.
- 2026-09-06: The final installed-Release regression passed English desktop
  and Chinese mobile checks, with both screenshots visually inspected.
  One-second intervals were 990-1009 ms, five-second intervals 5000-5001 ms;
  the 60-second selection refreshed immediately and reload restored three
  seconds. Poll and conntrack concurrency stayed at one, focus was preserved,
  and console/page errors were zero. Network, firewall and LuCI configuration
  hashes remain unchanged. Router-side branch/Release APKs and test directories
  are removed; the two installed plugin packages remain. Local verification
  assets and test tools are outside Git in the Windows temporary directory.

- 2026-09-06: v0.3 scope is confirmed: add per-line conntrack counts and fix
  verified WAN accounting defects. The user cancelled disconnect-total resets
  and deferred extra session keepalive changes unless expiry is reproduced.
  SSH/RPC inspection identifies the new router as ImmortalWrt 25.12.1 with
  Material theme and a 3600-second LuCI timeout. A private six-second RPC
  session remained valid across twelve seconds of polling. No router network,
  firewall or session-timeout configuration was changed.
- 2026-09-06: Source inspection and router data show why native direct reads
  are required: the conntrack table exceeded 800 KB, while rpcd file.read
  reads only 4096 bytes from zero-size proc files. Local checks reproduce WAN
  aggregation cancellation on a device counter reset and omission of eligible
  connected WAN members without default routes. Implementation, local logic
  checks, JavaScript/JSON/YAML/metadata validation, gettext validation, and
  upstream LuCI i18n extraction pass. The real LuCI preflight with intercepted
  v0.3 source passes 4004 connection records, native IPv6 parsing, ambiguity,
  malformed/empty recovery, 18 network rows, hotplug, CPU sampling and a WAN
  counter reset. Its desktop screenshot has no overlap or overflow. SDK builds
  and installed-package bilingual/soak verification are pending.
- 2026-09-06: Branch CI run `34005487219` passed validation and all six SDK
  builds for `fea9055`. Mobile inspection exposed Material hiding both table
  headings and pseudo labels. Native fallback labels and ordinary summary
  table markup fix the layout; the shared cell helper also avoids rendering
  null child placeholders as text. The corrected source preflight passes
  mobile layout, interval changes, shared slow reads, the 4004-record traffic
  fixture and sensor retries, with no console/page errors. Measured intervals
  are 988-1006 ms at one second and 4996-4998 ms at five seconds; maximum
  concurrent poll and connection-read requests are both one. Installed-package
  bilingual and eight-minute runtime verification remain pending.

- 2026-09-06: Final-source browser verification observed tightly spaced initial
  load and first-poll conntrack reads with interleaved browser request events.
  Those events alone do not prove transport overlap. Initial snapshots now
  omit conntrack to avoid redundant large reads during initialization, and
  the single poll callback owns that read. The full source-overridden suite
  passes with one concurrent poll and one concurrent conntrack read, 4004
  fixture records, 853186-byte real reads, 1-second intervals of 999-1006 ms,
  5-second intervals of 5001-5005 ms, 3-second soak intervals of 2988-3008 ms,
  DOM 414 before/after, heap delta +20884 bytes, and zero console/page errors.
  The existing `v0.3` Release was created before this correction and must be
  replaced after the new branch and tag CI runs; corrected package runtime
  verification is pending.
- 2026-09-06: Branch CI run `34010147829` passed validation and all six SDK
  targets for `7a8529f`. Its two ImmortalWrt 25.12.1 packages were checked with
  SHA-256 and `apk verify --allow-untrusted`, then installed offline. The view,
  menu, ACL and Chinese LMO hashes match their package manifests. The installed
  view hash is `7ae9defd02d278f3a4b02da1e1c1f33919c8c2a2c5b37527a314c1a228b8b682`.
  The full installed-package suite passes connection attribution, CPU and WAN
  calculations, 18 fixture rows, sensor retries, interval changes, focus and
  bilingual desktop/mobile layout. All six screenshots were visually checked.
  The eight-minute three-second soak recorded 160 samples at 2986-3014 ms
  (2999.937 ms average), DOM 414 before/after/maximum, forced-GC heap
  3184100 -> 3149860 bytes, one concurrent poll and conntrack request, one
  sensor request, no console/page errors and no logout. One-second intervals
  were 999-1008 ms and five-second intervals were 4992-5012 ms. Network,
  firewall and LuCI configuration hashes remain unchanged.
- 2026-09-06: Completed CI logs identify an earlier 24.10.8 delay as the
  258916431-byte SDK download taking about 20 minutes, not runner cleanup.
  The temporary diagnostic harness's negative request counts resulted from
  inserting an unbraced logging statement and do not establish duplicate
  browser completion events. That temporary harness is not part of the repo.
- 2026-09-06: Annotated tag `v0.3` now points to `7a8529f`. Tag CI run
  `34011144034` passed metadata validation, all six SDK builds and GitHub
  Release publication. It replaces the initial assets from `e733469`.
  The final non-draft, non-prerelease Release contains exactly the 12 expected
  firmware-prefixed packages and SHA256SUMS; downloading all 13 assets and
  checking every package checksum passes. The two ImmortalWrt 25.12.1 Release
  APKs pass router-side SHA-256 and `apk verify --allow-untrusted`, and were
  installed offline. Both installed packages report `0.3-r1`; view, menu, ACL
  and Chinese LMO hashes match the final Release manifests and the runtime
  which passed the eight-minute soak. The final installed-package interval
  check records 996-1002 ms at one second and 5000-5002 ms at five seconds,
  immediate 60-second selection, one concurrent poll and conntrack request,
  preserved focus, reload restoring three seconds, and no console/page errors.
  English desktop and Chinese mobile screenshots were checked again. Router
  network, firewall and LuCI configuration hashes remain unchanged. Router
  APKs and their temporary directory were removed; only installed packages
  remain. Automatic command policy blocked both scoped-batch and explicit-path
  local temporary-directory cleanup. Local test tools, screenshots and APKs
  therefore remain under the system temporary directory, outside Git.
- 2026-08-22: Contract created before implementation. Runtime behavior and
  acceptance criteria are locked.
- 2026-08-22: Verified on the target router that configured rows are `lan`,
  `modem`, `wan`, and `wan6`; current IPv4 and dynamic IPv6 default routes both
  use `pppoe-wan`; device counters are under `getNetworkDevices.*.stats`; CPU
  usage is returned by `luci.getCPUUsage`; timezone is `Asia/Shanghai`; and
  `sensors -j -A` returns valid empty JSON with no detected sensors.
- 2026-08-22: Minimal LuCI view, menu, read-only ACL, and English/Simplified
  Chinese catalogs implemented. JavaScript syntax, JSON parsing, whitespace,
  gettext validation, and LuCI i18n extraction pass.
- 2026-08-22: The first package build proved that a standalone package reached
  through a workspace symlink cannot resolve `../../luci.mk`; the Makefile now
  uses the position-independent `$(TOPDIR)/feeds/luci/luci.mk` include. No
  plugin source was compiled in that failed attempt.
- 2026-08-22: Package-level ImmortalWrt builds produce the main noarch APK and
  `luci-i18n-monitor-zh-cn`. Package contents are limited to the view, menu,
  read-only ACL, translation registration, LMO, and package metadata. The
  temporary source symlink is removed and the build tree retains exactly its
  four pre-existing Git status entries.
- 2026-08-22: The exact built files were installed on the target router and
  verified by SHA-256. The sensors command is allowed only as
  `/usr/sbin/sensors -j -A`; an authenticated `/bin/echo` file-exec request is
  denied. With the router's real empty sensors JSON, the page probes once and
  stops. An intercepted lm-sensors JSON fixture renders three named values at
  `42.13`, `39.00`, and `55.75` degrees C.
- 2026-08-22: Real Chrome checks pass in English and Simplified Chinese at
  1440x1000 and 390x844. The page shows `lan`, `modem`, `wan`, and `wan6`, has
  responsive mobile column labels, has no horizontal overflow or overlap, and
  preserves keyboard focus across refreshes.
- 2026-08-22: The final installed runtime passed a continuous 30-minute soak:
  366 system samples, 4973-5014 ms steady intervals (4999.98 ms average), DOM
  count 179 before/after/maximum, forced-GC heap 2923188 -> 2885548 bytes,
  zero console errors, zero page errors, preserved focus, and one sensors
  request. Router-side APKs and test artifacts were removed; only the two
  installed plugin packages remain.
- 2026-08-22: A WAN accounting audit found that `wan`, `wan6`, and `modem` all
  share layer-2 device `eth4`; active IPv4 `wan` and dynamic IPv6 `wan_6` share
  `pppoe-wan`; and `modem` explicitly disables its default route. The firewall
  flowtable contains `br-lan`, `eth4`, and `pppoe-wan`. Over a measured
  15-second interval, `eth4` RX increased by 412125 bytes while `pppoe-wan` RX
  increased by only 29808 bytes, proving that the flow-offloaded virtual PPP
  counter is not a reliable download source. WAN RX/download and TX/upload
  direction was confirmed against the inverse `br-lan` counter movement.
- 2026-08-22: WAN accounting correction is locked to `wan (eth4)`, using
  physical `eth4` counters and logical WAN connection state. The table also
  retains `lan (br-lan)`, with TX/download and RX/upload direction. Physical
  totals intentionally include link/protocol overhead and small management,
  ARP, and DHCP traffic. Router network, firewall, and flow-offload
  configuration must not be changed by implementation or testing. Routine
  soak verification is eight minutes; 30 minutes requires an explicit request.
- 2026-08-22: The accounting correction and its deterministic browser fixture
  are implemented pending package and router verification. The fixture gives
  `eth4`, `pppoe-wan`, and an unrelated default-route VPN deliberately divergent
  counters, checks inverse LAN bridge direction, and requires the overall rate
  to equal the single deduplicated WAN row. Sensor retry behavior is covered by
  two malformed results followed by valid JSON on the third probe.
- 2026-08-22: Direct authenticated RPC inspection showed that the target
  router's empty sensors result is `{}` on stdout with command exit code 1.
  Sensor validity is therefore determined by parsed JSON shape, not exit code.
- 2026-08-22: The corrected runtime passed deterministic browser fixtures.
  Deliberately divergent `br-lan`, `eth4`, `pppoe-wan`, and unrelated VPN
  counters produced only `lan (br-lan)` and `wan (eth4)`; LAN directions were
  reversed, WAN RX/download and TX/upload were exact, and the summary equaled
  the deduplicated WAN row. Two malformed sensor responses were retried and a
  third valid response with exit code 1 rendered all three temperatures.
- 2026-08-22: English and Simplified Chinese checks pass at 1440x1000 and
  390x844. All six screenshots, including traffic and sensor fixtures, were
  visually checked with no overflow, overlap, truncation, or table misalignment.
  The exact sensors command is allowed, `/bin/echo` file execution is denied,
  and the real empty sensors response causes exactly one request.
- 2026-08-22: The corrected runtime passed a continuous eight-minute soak:
  102 system samples, 4985-5014 ms steady intervals (4999.95 ms average), DOM
  count 163 before/after/maximum, forced-GC heap 2955848 -> 2913020 bytes, zero
  console errors, zero page errors, preserved focus, and one sensors request.
- 2026-08-22: Generic monitoring work is constrained to existing LuCI RPCs.
  ImmortalWrt source confirms that `getNetworkDevices` enumerates
  `/sys/class/net` and reads each device's kernel RX/TX byte counters, so no
  daemon, backend, dependency, or broader ACL is required. The new acceptance
  contract covers multiple LANs, multiple physical WANs, unmapped devices,
  tunnel devices, and a three-second polling interval; verification is pending.
- 2026-08-22: Firewall4 source confirms that runtime interfaces with
  `data.zone` are zone members and that `device` is the physical device while
  `l3_device` is the upper device. Rpcd-mod-luci also exposes the kernel
  point-to-point flag. WAN selection now follows those fields; deterministic
  and router verification are pending.
- 2026-08-22: The first generic-device browser fixture exposed JavaScript
  coercing a raw device's null uptime to zero and rendering a false connection
  timestamp. The shared formatter rejects null uptime; the completed retest is
  recorded below.
- 2026-08-22: The rebuilt `40170e1` main APK and unchanged `62cdf0b` Simplified
  Chinese APK pass apk signature verification against the build key. The main
  package was installed on the target router; its view, menu, and ACL hashes
  match the package manifest, while the installed Chinese LMO matches the
  unchanged translation package.
- 2026-08-22: Deterministic browser verification passes with 18 simultaneous
  rows covering multiple WANs and LANs, bridges, physical ports, VLAN, PPP,
  WireGuard, TUN, TAP, GRE, USB, VETH, disconnected devices, hotplug removal and
  insertion, shared-device deduplication, divergent WAN counters, and a counter
  reset. Missing raw-device uptime renders `-`, and focus survives row changes.
- 2026-08-22: English and Simplified Chinese screenshots at 1440/1280 desktop
  and 390-pixel mobile widths, including traffic and temperature fixtures, were
  visually inspected with no overflow, overlap, truncation, or field mismatch.
- 2026-08-22: The installed `40170e1` runtime passed a continuous eight-minute
  soak: 169 system samples, 2985-3015 ms steady intervals (3000 ms average), DOM
  count 211 before/after/maximum, forced-GC heap 2577788 -> 2542772 bytes, zero
  console errors, zero page errors, preserved focus, and one sensors request.
- 2026-08-22: Final cleanup removed router-side APKs, local screenshots and
  results, built APKs, package build/staging metadata, and the temporary source
  symlink. The router retains only the installed main and Chinese packages, and
  the ImmortalWrt tree retains exactly its four pre-existing Git status entries.
- 2026-08-23: Release `v0.1` constraints are locked before implementation.
  Official OpenWrt compatibility requires replacing ImmortalWrt's private
  `luci.getCPUUsage` RPC with exact read access to `/proc/stat`; deterministic
  invalid, reset, and consecutive-sample cases are required before release.
- 2026-08-23: Portable aggregate `/proc/stat` CPU sampling, exact read ACL,
  `0.1-r1` metadata, Apache-2.0 license, bilingual documentation, and the
  six-target build/Release workflow are implemented. JavaScript, JSON, YAML,
  gettext, LuCI extraction, and whitespace checks pass.
- 2026-08-23: The authoritative ImmortalWrt master tree built signed
  `luci-app-monitor-0.1-r1.apk` and `luci-i18n-monitor-zh-cn-0.1-r1.apk` as
  noarch packages. Signatures, package metadata, dependencies, and minimal
  file manifests pass inspection; the source-tree `.config` was restored and
  the temporary package symlink was removed.
- 2026-08-23: The local `0.1-r1` packages replaced the target router's prior
  date/hash packages after exact SHA-256 verification. Installed view, menu,
  ACL, and LMO hashes match the build. Deterministic fixtures pass aggregate
  multi-core CPU calculation, malformed input, baseline recovery, counter
  reset recovery, 18 mixed network rows, hotplug, WAN deduplication, and sensor
  retries. Six desktop/mobile screenshots were visually checked without
  overflow, overlap, truncation, or field mismatch.
- 2026-08-23: The local `0.1-r1` runtime passed a continuous eight-minute
  soak: 169 system samples, 2987-3015 ms steady intervals (2999.94 ms average),
  DOM count 211 before/after/maximum, forced-GC heap 2589884 -> 2563504 bytes,
  zero console errors, zero page errors, preserved focus, and one sensors
  request.
- 2026-08-23: Initial branch CI run `32614506647` passed metadata validation
  but all six SDK builds failed because `gh-action-sdk` mounted the package
  repository itself as a feed and therefore searched below the package root.
  Its logs report a missing action-feed index and no
  `package/luci-app-monitor/download` target. The feed root is now the checkout
  parent, placing `luci-app-monitor/Makefile` one directory below it as the SDK
  feed scanner requires.
- 2026-08-23: Branch CI run `32614919777` verifies the feed-root correction.
  Metadata validation and all six OpenWrt/ImmortalWrt SDK jobs built, collected
  exactly two packages, and uploaded their artifacts successfully.
- 2026-08-23: Annotated tag `v0.1` points to `1fabc2b`. Tag CI run
  `32615203399` passed all six SDK builds and published the non-draft,
  non-prerelease GitHub Release. Its assets are exactly 12 target-prefixed
  packages plus `SHA256SUMS`; downloading all 13 assets and checking the file
  verifies every package checksum.
- 2026-08-23: The target router replaced the local build with the downloaded
  ImmortalWrt master Release packages. Router-side SHA-256 and `apk verify`
  pass before installation; the installed APK source is `/feed/luci-app-monitor`,
  and the view, menu, ACL, and Chinese LMO hashes match the Release manifests.
- 2026-08-23: The Release runtime passed the full deterministic fixture suite,
  bilingual desktop/mobile checks, and an eight-minute soak: 169 system
  samples, 2985-3015 ms intervals (2999.994 ms average), DOM count 211
  before/after/maximum, forced-GC heap 3031900 -> 2981944 bytes, zero console
  errors, zero page errors, preserved focus, and one sensors request. All six
  screenshots were visually checked without overflow, overlap, truncation, or
  column mismatch. Router APKs and local build/test artifacts were removed;
  only the two installed packages remain, and the ImmortalWrt tree retains
  exactly its four pre-existing Git status entries with an unchanged `.config`.
- 2026-08-23: Active CPU verification on the two-core Release router captured
  31 distinct complete `/proc/stat` RPC responses and independently recomputed
  every aggregate sample before comparing it with the corresponding rendered
  value. Five stable samples per phase produced medians of
  7.328990228013029% at baseline, 51.333333333333336% with CPU 0 pinned busy,
  100% with CPUs 0 and 1 pinned busy, and 5.676126878130217% after recovery.
  The maximum RPC-to-UI difference was 0.004925864909388622 percentage points;
  the initial sample rendered `-` as specified, and there were zero invalid
  stable values, console errors, or page errors. All three self-terminating
  27-second load processes exited with code 0; exact-PID and marker checks
  confirmed no router-side test process remained, and no package was installed.
- 2026-08-23: The `v0.2` contract is locked before implementation: add one
  native, non-persistent one-to-60-second refresh selector before the summary,
  default it to three seconds, apply changes immediately without overlapping
  requests, publish bilingual release notes, and retain the eight-minute
  routine soak requirement.
- 2026-08-23: The user withdrew `/home/ht/immortalwrt` as a usable build
  environment. A path with source-shaped files still exists locally, but its
  provenance and completeness are not trusted. `v0.2` will use branch CI SDK
  artifacts for router verification before its release tag is created.
- 2026-08-23: The minimal `v0.2` selector, guarded dynamic poll registration,
  `0.2-r1` metadata, bilingual catalogs and documentation, versioned changelog,
  Release-note extraction, and browser assertions are implemented. JavaScript,
  JSON, YAML, gettext, upstream LuCI i18n extraction, metadata, and Git
  whitespace checks pass; SDK builds and router verification are pending.
- 2026-08-23: Branch CI run `32636576506` passed metadata validation and all
  six OpenWrt/ImmortalWrt SDK builds, each collecting and uploading exactly two
  `0.2-r1` packages. Its ImmortalWrt master APKs were installed on the router;
  package versions and archive-to-installed-file hashes pass. The first browser
  preflight stopped because Playwright `selectOption()` had not focused the
  selector before the focus-preservation assertion; the test now establishes
  focus explicitly, and runtime verification remains pending.
- 2026-08-23: The corrected full-suite browser preflight passes. Measured
  one-second intervals were 991-1015 ms and five-second intervals were
  4995-5010 ms; the 60-second boundary produced only its immediate request,
  maximum concurrent system requests were one, and reload restored three
  seconds. DOM count stayed at 275, forced-GC heap changed by 6616 bytes, focus
  survived refreshes and row hotplug, and console/page errors were zero. All
  six English/Chinese desktop/mobile, traffic, and sensor screenshots were
  visually checked without overflow, overlap, truncation, or misalignment.
- 2026-08-23: The user explicitly requested one additional three-minute soak at
  a selected one-second interval for `v0.2`. The existing browser suite now
  accepts a validated, test-only `MONITOR_SOAK_INTERVAL`; its default remains
  three seconds and it does not alter or persist plugin state.
- 2026-08-23: The requested one-second runtime soak passed on the installed
  `0.2-r1` release candidate: 204 samples over three minutes, 981-1041 ms
  intervals (1000.158 ms average), DOM count 275 before/after/maximum, forced-GC
  heap 3077532 -> 3100088 bytes (+22556), zero console errors, zero page errors,
  preserved focus, and one sensors request. The six fixture and bilingual
  desktop/mobile screenshots were visually checked without overflow, overlap,
  truncation, or column mismatch. The HTTP observer saw a maximum of two
  concurrent `system.info` requests because LuCI's global status request can
  interleave; the interval fixture's application poll callback remained at one
  active request and the view's shared Promise prevents duplicate snapshots.
- 2026-08-23: Annotated tag `v0.2` points to `1a200a5`. Tag CI run
  `32638746412` passed metadata validation and all six SDK builds, then
  published the non-draft, non-prerelease GitHub Release. Its assets are
  exactly 12 target-prefixed packages plus `SHA256SUMS`; downloading all 13
  assets and checking the 12 listed hashes succeeds.
- 2026-08-23: The target router force-reinstalled the two ImmortalWrt master
  Release APKs offline after exact SHA-256 and `apk verify` checks. Both
  installed packages report `0.2-r1`; the installed view, menu, ACL, and
  Simplified Chinese LMO hashes match the Release manifests and the long-tested
  release candidate. The final short browser regression measured one-second
  intervals of 994-1009 ms, five-second intervals of 4992-4996 ms, and default
  three-second intervals of 2992-3005 ms (2999.667 ms average). DOM count stayed
  at 275, forced-GC heap changed by 6616 bytes, focus was preserved, sensors ran
  once, and console/page errors were zero. All six bilingual desktop/mobile,
  traffic, and sensor screenshots were visually checked without overflow,
  overlap, truncation, or column mismatch. Router-side uploaded and prior stray
  APKs, local Release/test assets, screenshots, results, CI logs, and the
  temporary Playwright install were removed; the router retains only the two
  installed plugin packages and no test process.
